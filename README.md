## 1.- Overview of the analysis.
After a vacation in Hawai, we came up with an idea to establish there and because the delightment of what surfing was; what would be better than open a surf and shake shop? Serving surfboards and icecream to locals and turists. And even when I will use my savings, I would need more investors to take this idea forward.

I met W. Avi, who is a passionete of surfing and is interested into invest, but he's worried about the climate, he want to know all the possible statistics related just to make sure that a surfing and ice cream shop would be a profitable business in this place. 

So what we would do, is to present all the results related with the climate in two of the main months of the year, from different seasons, just to see if there is a considerable difference on the weather between them or if, based on statistics from previous years, it would be a good idea to go forward and come this dream true.

## 2.- Results: Provide a bullet list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

- June summary statistics

- December summary statistics

Based on those statistics, we could see that there is not a relevant difference on the weather between those two months, for example:

 - The minimum temp, for december it's marked on 56 degrees, and for June is 64, so there are only 5 grades of difference, which is minimum bearing in mind that the seasons are opposite.
 
 - The median for both months is pretty good as well. For December would be 71, and for June with only 4 grades of differece would be 71. Meaning that the temperature is quite stable during those two months. 

 - The maximun temperature for those two months only marked 2 grades of difference, which only support what we already said in the previous points.


## 3.- Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.

Taking into account the temperature for these two months, it seems to be a pretty good idea, to open a surf and shake shop; as we noticed during those two months remains
a constant comfordable temperature for the purpose of the business. 

Nevertheless, we should consider as well some other details and analysis that are fundamental for this business too, like the wind speed, the significant wave height prediction and the precipitation analysis for those two months. We should show an analysis like this next image, and having in mind that W. Avi had already an experience investing in a surf shop before, this would be a very important and serious subject to contemplate.

According to this next table, we could see if there is any risk to have a drop on sales, or even close the shop during a certain period of time, based on the weather analysis, specially in the intensity of precipitation.
