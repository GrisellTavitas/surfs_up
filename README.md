SQLite - SQLAlchemy - Flask

## 1.- Overview of the analysis.
After a vacation in Hawai, we came up with an idea to establish there and because the delightment of what surfing was; what would be better than open a surf and shake shop? Serving surfboards and icecream to locals and turists. And even when I will use my savings, I would need more investors to take this idea forward.

I met W. Avi, who is a passionete of surfing and is interested into invest, but he's worried about the climate, he want to know all the possible statistics related just to make sure that a surfing and ice cream shop would be a profitable business in this place. 

So what we would do, is to present all the results related with the climate in two of the main months of the year, from different seasons, just to see if there is a considerable difference on the weather between them or if, based on statistics from previous years, it would be a good idea to go forward and come this dream true.

## 2.- Results: Provide a bullet list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
